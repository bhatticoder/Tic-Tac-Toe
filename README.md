Implementation of Adversial Search of Artifical Intelligence in which AI is soo powerful that it can easily beat human intelligence.
It reads all the possible moves of human and work according to these moves and it is difficult for human to beat it.
Adversial Search follows the algorithm of min max and alpha beta pruning. 
In this algorithm the AI only follows the path of best possible moves. 
It saves a lot of time of machine. It doesnot search the unwanted nodes in trees. 
This search mostly used in game theories Like Tic Tac Toe and other games like that
